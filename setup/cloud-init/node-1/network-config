# This file contains a netplan-compatible configuration which cloud-init will
# apply on first-boot (note: it will *not* update the config after the first
# boot). Please refer to the cloud-init documentation and the netplan reference
# for full details:
#
# https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/network-config.html
# https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/network-config-format-v2.html
# https://netplan.io/reference
#
# Please note that, at this time, there is no way to specify the wifi
# regulatory region in the netplan or cloud-init configuration (LP: #1951586),
# and the /etc/default/crda configuration file has been removed. If you need to
# specify a regulatory region, append the following to the line in
# "cmdline.txt" (adjusting "GB" to your own region):
#
# cfg80211.ieee80211_regdom=GB
#
# Please note that the YAML format employed by this file is sensitive to
# differences in whitespace; if you are editing this file in an editor (like
# Notepad) which uses literal tabs, take care to only use spaces for
# indentation. See the following link for more details:
